# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a psuedo-random password generator for employee/user use.  The generator allows the selection of password-length and password-criteria through prompts to create the criteria needed by the user.  Once generated the ouput will be displayed on the webpage for the employee/user to obtain and use.  In completing this project I learned about manipulating arrays, creating interactive prompts, functions, and for-loops.

## Installation

This application is browser based, and will run in the browser.  No extra installation steps are needed.

## Usage

Usage is intended for employees/users to create psuedo-random passwords of a specified criteria and length. To use the application:

1.Click on the large generate button.

2.Enter in your desired password length into the prompt.

3.Select the criteria that you desire using the prompts for uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.

4.Your password will then be displayed on the webpage.  It will have been generated with the criteria that the user set.

This process can be repeated as much as necessary.  Just hit the generate button to start the password generator again.
