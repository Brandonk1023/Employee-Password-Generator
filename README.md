# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The motivation behind this project was to create a psuedo-random password generator for employee/user use.  The generator allows the selection of password-length and password-criteria through prompts to create the criteria needed by the user.  Once generated the ouput will be displayed on the webpage for the employee/user to obtain and use.  In completing this project I learned about manipulating arrays, creating interactive prompts, functions, and for-loops.
